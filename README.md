A code for the sumplete game. v1.0

What it does now
It allows the user to mark the cells as part of the solution and erease the ones they do not belong to the solution. It tells you when you win or lose

What is next?
-The main idea is to create complex puzzles that need Number Theory (modular arithmetic, diophantine equations, etc) results in order to be solved. The idea will be to translate these techniques into a function that checks if a big puzzle is solvable

-UX improvements (colors, shapes, rezise,...)

-Add extra lives, the acum sum of the already marked cells

-A bank of puzzles
